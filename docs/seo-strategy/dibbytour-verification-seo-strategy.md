# DibbyTour SEO Strategy: Pages We Will Outrank

## 🎯 THE PIVOT: Verification, Not Housing

**OLD APPROACH (Would Fail):**
- "Travel nurse housing near Cedars-Sinai" → Compete with June Homes, Furnished Finder (they have 2,000+ listings)
- "Apartment scam checker tool" → Compete with FTC.gov, Zillow, Apartments.com (DR 90+ sites)

**NEW APPROACH (Will Win):**
- "Remote apartment inspection service" → We're the ONLY physical verification service
- "Travel nurse apartment VERIFICATION" → Nobody offers this specific service
- "Verify Craigslist rental" → Zero dedicated services exist
