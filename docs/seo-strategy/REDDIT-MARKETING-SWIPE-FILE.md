## 📝 READY-TO-POST TEMPLATES

### TEMPLATE 1: "I Almost Got Scammed" Story Post

**Best for:** r/ApartmentHunting, r/Scams, r/personalfinance, city subreddits

```
Title: I almost lost $2,400 to a rental scam on Facebook Marketplace - here's the red flags I missed

So I'm moving to [Austin/NYC/Denver] for work and found what seemed like a perfect apartment. 
2BR in [neighborhood] for $1,400/month. Photos looked great, landlord was "out of the country 
for work" but could FaceTime.

Here's where I almost messed up:

🚩 Red flag 1: Rent was $300-400 below market for the area
🚩 Red flag 2: "Landlord" couldn't meet in person or have anyone show it
🚩 Red flag 3: Wanted a wire transfer for deposit + first month ($2,400)
🚩 Red flag 4: Rushing me to sign because "other applicants are interested"
🚩 Red flag 5: Lease looked legit but had weird formatting errors

What saved me: I did a reverse image search on the photos. They were from a Zillow 
listing from 2021 - the apartment had already been rented.

If you can't physically see an apartment before signing, at MINIMUM:
- Reverse image search the photos
- Google the address to verify it exists
- Call the actual property management company (not the number in the listing)
- Have someone local do a drive-by
- Or use an inspection service to verify in person

Don't be like me and almost learn a $2,400 lesson.

What scam red flags have you all seen?

### TEMPLATE 2: Helpful "How To" Post

**Best for:** r/ApartmentHunting, r/moving, city subreddits

```
Title: Moving to [City] sight-unseen? Here's my complete checklist for not getting scammed

Just successfully moved from [other city] to [target city] without ever seeing my apartment 
in person. Here's everything I did to make sure I wasn't sending my deposit to a scammer:

**Before you even look at listings:**
- Research average rent for your target neighborhoods (Zumper, RentCafe work great)
- If a listing is 20%+ below average, be VERY skeptical

**When you find a listing:**
- [ ] Reverse image search ALL photos
- [ ] Google the address + "for rent" to see if it's listed elsewhere
- [ ] Check county records for who actually owns the property
- [ ] Look up the "landlord" name + "scam" 
- [ ] Video call with the landlord (scammers often refuse)

**Before sending any money:**
- [ ] Get a copy of the lease to review
- [ ] Verify landlord identity matches property records
- [ ] Have someone physically verify the apartment exists
- [ ] NEVER wire money or use Zelle/Venmo for deposits

**What I actually did:**
I hired someone to go inspect the apartment in person, take photos, and verify the 
landlord was real. Cost me $150 but saved me from potentially losing $3,000+.

Happy to answer questions if anyone's going through the same thing.

### TEMPLATE 3: Answer Post (For Existing Threads)

**Use on:** Posts asking "is this a scam?" or "how do I verify an apartment"

```
A few ways to verify:

1. **Reverse image search** - Scammers steal photos from old listings
2. **County property records** - Verify who actually owns the address
3. **Call the property directly** - Not the number in the listing, the actual building management
4. **Google the address** - See if it's listed on multiple sites with different info

If you really can't visit in person, there are services that will send someone to 
verify the apartment exists and matches the listing. I used one when I relocated 
and it caught water damage the landlord didn't disclose.

The $100-150 is worth it compared to losing your whole deposit.
```

### TEMPLATE 4: Travel Nurse Specific

**Best for:** r/TravelNursing, r/nursing, travel nurse Facebook groups

```
Title: Fellow travelers - how are you verifying housing before 13-week contracts?

3rd contract and I've finally got a system down for not getting screwed on housing:

Week 1-2 after accepting contract:
- Start searching Furnished Finder, Airbnb monthly, Facebook groups
- Screenshot EVERYTHING (prices change, listings disappear)

For any listing that looks good:
- Video call with host/landlord (if they refuse, walk away)
- Ask for references from previous travel nurses
- Google the address to make sure it exists
- If still skeptical, have it inspected in person

I learned the hard way on my first contract - "great deal" turned out to be nothing 
like the photos and the "landlord" ghosted me after I paid.

Now I factor $100-200 into my housing budget for verification, especially in new cities.

What's everyone else doing? Especially curious about markets like LA, NYC, and SF 
where competition is insane.

### TEMPLATE 5: International Student Specific

**Best for:** r/IntlStudents, r/immigration, university subreddits

```
Title: PSA for international students: US rental scams target YOU specifically

Coming to the US for grad school and trying to find housing from abroad? 
Scammers know you can't easily verify apartments, so please be careful.

Things that got my friends scammed:
- "Send deposit now, I'll mail you the keys" - SCAM
- Prices that seem too good for the area - probably SCAM
- Can't show you the apartment because they're "traveling" - SCAM
- Asking for wire transfer or Western Union - DEFINITELY SCAM

What actually works:
1. Your university's off-campus housing office (they vet listings)
2. Having a friend already in the US check it out
3. Using a professional inspection service if you don't know anyone
4. Sticking to established platforms (though scams exist there too)

Don't lose your first month's rent + deposit before you even land. 
It's worth spending $100-200 to have someone verify the place is real.

Any other tips from people who navigated this successfully?

### TEMPLATE 6: City-Specific Post

**Best for:** r/Austin, r/Denver, r/AskNYC, etc.

```
Title: Moving to [City] in [Month] - is the rental market as scammy as I'm reading?

Taking a job at [company] and trying to find an apartment from [current city]. 
I keep reading about rental scams in [City] and I'm paranoid now.

Is it really that bad? What should I look out for specifically in [City]?

My situation:
- Budget: $[X]/month
- Looking at: [neighborhoods]
- Timeline: need to sign by [date]
- Can't visit in person before moving

Any [City] locals willing to share tips or warnings?
```

## 💬 COMMENT TEMPLATES

### For "Is This a Scam?" Posts

```
Some quick checks:
- Reverse image search the photos (Google Images or TinEye)
- Look up the address on county property records
- If the price is way below market, that's usually the biggest red flag

If you can't verify in person, it might be worth having someone inspect it 
for you. Saved me once when relocating.
```

### For "How Do I Find Housing Remotely?" Posts

```
Did this twice for work relocations. My process:
1. Only work with verified property management companies
2. Video call with actual landlord (not just "representative")
3. Have the apartment inspected in person before signing
4. Never wire money - use credit card or check when possible

The inspection cost me ~$150 but caught issues both times. Worth it.
```

### For Scam Victim Posts

```
So sorry this happened to you. For others reading:

Prevention tips:
- NEVER wire money for deposits
- Reverse image search listing photos
- Verify property ownership through county records
- If you can't visit, have someone verify in person

Report to: FTC (reportfraud.ftc.gov), local police, and the platform where you found the listing.

3. Or add in profile bio: "I used DibbyTour when I relocated"
4. Link to helpful content first (your blog, guides) not sales pages

**Profile optimization:**
- Bio: "Relocated 3x for work. Ask me about verifying apartments remotely."
- Pinned post: Helpful guide that soft-sells your service
- Activity: 80% helpful comments, 20% own posts
